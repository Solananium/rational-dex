### ⚠️ What could be risky

There **are** potential issues if you aren’t careful:

1. **Wrong `owner`**:
   If the client creates the account but sets `owner = system_program`, the program cannot safely trust the data — it could be modified off-chain.

2. **Program trust assumption**:
   The program must validate that the loaded zero-copy accounts have:

   ```rust
   assert_eq!(account.owner, ctx.program_id);
   ```

   or let Anchor’s `#[account(zero)]` handle this check automatically.

3. **Re-use of accounts**:
   If a client reuses a zero-copy account from a previous proposal, it could cause logical inconsistencies (stale data or mismatched layout). Programs should handle this via versioning or zero-checking.

4. **Closing accounts**:
   Because the client owns the private key, they can close the account (sending lamports back to themselves).
   Your program can prevent this by holding the account rent-exempt balance locked (never calling `close`), or by verifying the account still exists before using it.
