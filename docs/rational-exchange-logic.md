## A New Model: Consensus-Driven DEX

Modern blockchain governance systems such as conviction voting, are redefining how communities make decisions. Conviction voting allows token holders to express the strength of their beliefs by locking their tokens for extended periods. The longer the lock, the stronger the vote. When combined with delegation, this mechanism not only increases participation but also sharpens the collective will of a decentralized network.

This principle can be applied to create a **Consensus DEX**—a decentralized exchange where token prices are not solely determined by market trades, but also by the shared beliefs of stakeholders. Here’s how it could function:

### **Price Discovery Through Conviction Voting**

- **Commit and Reveal Voting**: Users first submit a hidden vote (encrypted or hashed) for a token’s price. After a set period, they reveal their vote.
- **Conviction Weighting**: Votes are weighted based on the duration of token lockup. This reflects the voter’s confidence and long-term commitment to the token.
- **Median-Based Outcome**: The final price is determined by the median of all revealed, weighted votes. This method filters out extreme outliers and reduces the risk of manipulation.
- **Stakeholder-Driven Prices**: Unlike traditional DEXs, this model incorporates the voices of token holders, developers, community members, and long-term investors—those who are genuinely invested in the token’s mission and impact.

### **Why This Matters**

- **Value Over Volume**: Tokens that address real-world problems or contribute to public goods are more likely to command higher prices in a consensus-driven system, reflecting genuine community belief and utility rather than speculative hype.
- **Resilience to Manipulation**: Because votes are locked and outliers are eliminated through median calculation, price manipulation becomes significantly more difficult.
- **Collective Price Responsibility**: Stakeholders have a direct role in shaping prices and are held accountable for the convictions they express.

### **Towards a Consensus Economy**

This model transforms DEXs from platforms driven by individual traders into spaces where informed consensus shapes outcomes. It mirrors democratic governance more closely than traditional finance, allowing token ecosystems to reflect shared values and long-term vision rather than just short-term market dynamics.

In a consensus economy, every individual impacted by a token’s value has a voice in determining its price. This could lead to more sustainable, value-aligned crypto ecosystems and shift the focus from hype-driven speculation to meaningful innovation and real-world impact.

## Future Goals:

This is an experimental framework. In the future, it can be refined by incorporating a **reputation score** instead of simply relying on the amount of stake. The reputation score can be calculated through a **Schelling game**, where users' identities remain **pseudoanonymous**, much like social media accounts. Reputatiosn scores is also resistance to sybil attacks.

A user’s profile will be validated based on the **rationality** of their contributions and their **specialization**, which is inferred from their **profile posts** and engagement. Over time, **academics and experts** will be increasingly involved in the decision-making process, ensuring a more informed and credible governance model.
